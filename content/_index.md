The Computational Humanities Research community is an international and interdisciplinary community that supports researchers with an interest in computational approaches to the humanities. Ultimately, the goal of the community is to set up a research-oriented, open-access computational humanities journal. The [workshop](cfp) on Computational Humanities Research (CHR) will be an online event.
