We cordially invite you and other interested parties to join the [Computational Humanities
Research forum](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/)! The forum
serves as an asynchronous platform to discuss all ideas and questions related to
computational humanities research. These can be in-depth discussions about fundamental
topics and questions of the discipline, or very practical ones, for example about how best
to tackle a certain technical (coding) problem. And everything in between. Come join!
