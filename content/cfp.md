### Description
In the humanities and related social sciences, the use of computational, statistical, and
mathematical approaches has increased in recent years. The research can be characterized
by (i) relying on quantifiable rather than strictly qualitative evidence; (ii) making
explicit and formalizing theory with the help of mathematical and computational
models; (iii) making statistical inferences about model parameters; (iv) the use of
computational and automatic procedures for processing and analyzing data; and (v)
searching for computational analogies through which theories from different disciplines
can be unified. And yet, despite the undeniable growth of this new research area, many
scholars still feel that there is no suitable research-oriented venue to present and
publish their computational work that does not lose sight of questions relevant to the
humanities. As such, we aim to fill this niche by creating a community for Computational
Humanities Research. Ultimately, the goal of the community is to set up a
research-oriented, open-access computational humanities journal. This workshop on
Computational Humanities Research (CHR) will serve as a stepping stone to this journal. 

### Important dates
- **July 20, 2020**: Submission deadline;
- **August 24, 2020**: Notification of acceptance;
- **September 18, 2020**: Camera-ready papers due;
- **November 18-20, 2020**: Online Workshop.

### Venue
This workshop will be an online event. More details will follow, *Organized by the
[DHLab](http://dhlab.nl) of the KNAW Humanities Cluster* 

### Illustrative Topics and Questions
- Statistical methods for Humanities data analysis;
- Hypothesis-driven Humanities research;
- Interpretation of results from statistical, empirical, and data-driven methods
- Development of empirical methods; 
- Translation and transfer of methods from disciplines, such as economics, biology,
  physics, psychology, and complexity science;
- Drawing computational analogies to unify disciplines;
- Modeling bias and uncertainty in the humanities;
- Method standardization;
- Statistical evaluation of categorisation / periodisation;
- How to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations;
- Explanatory models for Humanities research;

### Workshop goals
The aim of the workshop is threefold: 

- **Community**: This gathering serves as a means to foster the formation of a community of
  humanities scholars that rely on a wide range of computational approaches. We consider
  this community to be an addition to the digital humanities landscape.

- **Infrastructure**: An important goal of this workshop is to find new ways of sharing our
  ‘research stories’. This includes the introduction of pre-registration of studies, which
  entails the submission of a registered report that includes theoretical justification,
  experimental design, and the proposed statistical analysis. Additionally, we want to
  rethink the reviewing process for interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational
  approaches to answer questions relevant to the humanities. Finally, the workshop aims to
  make all publications, code, and data freely available, thus encouraging research
  transparency and replication of studies.

- **Dissemination**: Our goal is to publish (a selection) of papers from the workshop in a
  special journal issue, which is yet to be determined.


### Types of Submission
We accept three types of submissions:

- **Long Papers**. Long papers report on completed, original and unpublished results. The
  maximum length is 16 pages, plus up to 2 pages of references. We welcome the use of
  appendices or other supplementary information. Accepted papers are expected to be
  presented at the workshop and will be published in the proceedings of the workshop.

- **Short Papers**. Short papers report on original and unpublished results. The maximum
  length is 8 pages, plus up to 2 pages of references. Besides smaller, focussed
  contributions, short papers may present work in progress, negative results, and opinion
  pieces. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be
  published in the proceedings of the workshop.

- **Tutorials**. We also accept proposals for *online* tutorials. These tutorials are
  meant to highlight specific computational approaches and show how they can be
  implemented across different disciplines in the humanities. The maximum length is 4
  pages, plus up to 1 page of references. Tutorial proposal should at minimum include
  description of method(s), goals, relevance to CHR, as well as information on the
  prerequisite knowledge, and logistical requirements. Tutorial proposals will not be
  published in the proceedings.

All papers and tutorial proposals will undergo double-blind peer-review.


### Submission Formats
Papers to CHR2020 may be submitted in either of the following two formats:

1. **LaTeX Papers** should be prepared using the [CHR2020 latex
   template](https://github.com/cohure/CoHuRe/raw/master/chr2020_latex_template.zip); 
2. **doc(x) papers** may be submitted only for review.

All final, accepted papers must be submitted in LaTeX using the provided template.
Final papers not submitted in this format will **not** be accepted.

Papers should be submitted to the CHR2020 workshop Easychair website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr2020 (**Note: not open yet**).

Accepted papers will be published in the [CEUR workshop proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/).
