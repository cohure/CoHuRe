<hr>
<p>In the humanities and related social sciences, the use of computational, statistical, and
mathematical approaches has increased in recent years. The research can be characterized
by (i) relying on quantifiable rather than strictly qualitative evidence; (ii) making
explicit and formalizing narrative theory with the help of mathematical and computational
models; (iii) making statistical inferences about model parameters; (iv) the use of
computational and automatic procedures for processing and analyzing data; and (v)
searching for computational analogies through which theories from different disciplines
can be unified. And yet, despite the undeniable growth of this new research area, many
scholars still feel that there is no suitable research-oriented venue to present and
publish their computational work that does not lose sight of questions relevant to the
humanities. As such, we aim to fill this niche by creating a community for Computational
Humanities Research. Ultimately, the goal of the community is to set up a
research-oriented, open-access computational humanities journal. This workshop on
Computational Humanities Research (CHR) will serve as a stepping stone to this journal.</p>
<h3 id="illustrative-topics-and-questions">Illustrative Topics and Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Statistical methods for Humanities data analysis;</li>
<li>Hypothesis-driven Humanities research;</li>
<li>Interpretation of results from statistical, empirical, and data-driven methods</li>
<li>Development of empirical methods;</li>
<li>Translation and transfer of methods from disciplines, such as economics, biology,
physics, psychology, and complexity science;</li>
<li>Drawing computational analogies to unify disciplines;</li>
<li>Modeling bias and uncertainty in the humanities;</li>
<li>Method standardization;</li>
<li>Statistical evaluation of categorisation / periodisation;</li>
<li>How to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations;</li>
<li>Explanatory models for Humanities research;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workshop-goals">Workshop goals</h3>
<p>The aim of the workshop is threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Community</strong>: This gathering serves as a means to foster the formation of a community of
humanities scholars that rely on a wide range of computational approaches. We consider
this community to be an addition to the digital humanities landscape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: An important goal of this workshop is to find new ways of sharing our
‘research stories’. This includes the introduction of pre-registration of studies, which
entails the submission of a registered report that includes theoretical justification,
experimental design, and the proposed statistical analysis. Additionally, we want to
rethink the reviewing process for interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational
approaches to answer questions relevant to the humanities. Finally, the workshop aims to
make all publications, code, and data freely available, thus encouraging research
transparency and replication of studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissemination</strong>: Our goal is to publish (a selection) of papers from the workshop in a
special journal issue, which is yet to be determined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-submission">Types of Submission</h3>
<p>We accept three types of submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Long Papers</strong>. Long papers report on completed, original and unpublished results. The
maximum length is 8 pages (two columns), excluding references. We welcome the use of
appendices or other supplementary information. Accepted papers are expected to be
presented at the workshop and will be published in the proceedings of the workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short Papers</strong>. Short papers report on original and unpublished results. The maximum
length is 4 pages (two columns), excluding references. Besides smaller, focussed
contributions, short papers may present work in progress, negative results, and opinion
pieces. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be
published in the proceedings of the workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tutorials</strong>. We also accept proposals for tutorials. These tutorials are meant to
highlight specific computational approaches and show how they can be implemented across
different disciplines in the humanities. The maximum length is 2 pages (two columns),
excluding references. Tutorial proposal should at minimum include description of
method(s), goals, relevance to CHR, as well as information on the prerequisite
knowledge, and material/logistical requirements. Tutorial proposals will not be
published in the proceedings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All papers and tutorial proposals will undergo double-blind peer-review.</p>
