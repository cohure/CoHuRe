        <p>In the humanities and related social sciences, the use of computational, statistical, and
mathematical approaches has increased in recent years. The research can be characterized
by (i) relying on quantifiable rather than strictly qualitative evidence, (ii) making explicit and formalizing narrative theory with the help of mathematical and computational models, (iii) making statistical inferences about model parameters, (iv) the use of computational and automatic procedures for processing and analyzing data, and (v) searching for computational analogies through which theories from different disciplines
can be unified. And yet, despite the undeniable growth of this new research area, many scholars still feel
that there is no suitable research-oriented venue to present and publish their
computational work that does not lose sight of questions relevant to the humanities. As
such, we aim to fill this niche by creating a community for Computational Humanities
Research. Ultimately, the goal of the community is to set up a research-oriented,
open-access computational humanities journal. The <a href="cfp">workshop</a> on Computational Humanities
Research (CHR) will serve as a stepping stone to this journal.</p>
