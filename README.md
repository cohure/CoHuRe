## Computational Humanities Research

Despite the growing use of computational methods in humanities research by an
increasingly wide variety of scholars, many interdisciplinary scholars
(including ourselves) still feel that there is no suitable research-oriented
venue to present and/or publish robust, computational work that does not lose
sight of questions relevant to the humanities. As such, we aim to fill this
niche by creating a community for computational humanities researchers.

Ultimately, the goal of the computational humanities community is to set up a
research-oriented computational humanities journal and conference. In the
coming months, we will announce a workshop that is open to (short and
long) full paper submissions. This workshop will serve as a stepping stone to a
new, open-access journal of Computational Humanities Research.

We cordially invite you and other interested parties to join the conversation
about future steps! Add your name to
