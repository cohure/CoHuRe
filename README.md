## Computational Humanities Research

We aim to create a community for computational humanities research. 
This involves robust, computational work that does not lose focus of the humanities question. 
Who's in?

We believe there is a niche for a research-oriented computational humanities journal and conference. 
In the coming months, we will announce a workshop that is open to full (short and long) paper submissions. 

This workshop serves as a stepping stone to a journal of Computational Humanities Research. 

We invite others to join the conversation!
