# Computational Humanities Research

The Computational Humanities Research community is an international and interdisciplinary society that supports researchers with an interest in computational approaches to the humanities. Ultimately, the goal of the community is to set up a research-oriented, open-access computational humanities journal. The [workshop on Computational Humanities Research](https://www.computational-humanities-research.org/cfp/) (CHR) will be an online event.

## Join the community

We cordially invite you and other interested parties to join the [Computational Humanities Research forum](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/)! The forum serves as an asynchronous platform to discuss all ideas and questions related to computational humanities research. These can be in-depth discussions about fundamental topics and questions of the discipline, or very practical ones, for example about how best to tackle a certain technical (coding) problem. And everything in between. Come join!
